### Hello 👋

My name is Alonso Silva and I'm a Senior Researcher (Niveau III A) in Machine Learning at [Safran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safran), an international high-tech company operating in the aircraft engine, rocket engine, aerospace-component and defense domains where I'm in charge of proposing and evaluating predictive maintenance strategies.

I received my Ph.D. in Physics from the [École Supérieure d'Électricité (Supélec)](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) in 2010. I did my Ph.D. at [INRIA Sophia-Antipolis](https://www.inria.fr/en) under the direction of Professor Eitan Altman. Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.Sc. of Mathematical Engineering and my Mathematical Engineering degree from the [Department of Mathematical Engineering (DIM)](http://www.dim.uchile.cl/) at the [Universidad de Chile](https://www.uchile.cl/), in 2004 and 2006. I have previously worked as Research Engineer at [Bell Labs France](https://www.bell-labs.com/) from September 2012 to August 2018, as Postdoctoral Researcher in the [Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), from September 2011 to August 2012 at [INRIA Paris Rocquencourt](https://www.inria.fr/en) from September 2010 to August 2011 and as Reseach Consultant/Intern at [Bell Labs Headquarters](https://www.bell-labs.com/) in New Jersey from March to May 2010.  I have received the Best Paper Award at IEEE SmartGridComm'17, UNet'17, the Second Best Paper Award at MSN'11 and the Best Student Paper Award at Valuetools'08.
